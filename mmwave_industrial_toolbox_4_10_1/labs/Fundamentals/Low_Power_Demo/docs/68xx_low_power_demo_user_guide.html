Overview of 68xx Low Power Demo
===========

This  lab showcases different strategies for power optimization using the xWR6843 and xWR6443 devices. The included project is the [68xx Out-of-Box Demo](../../../Out_Of_Box_Demo/docs/Out_Of_Box_Demo_User_Guide.html) but provides a software-based sequence for putting the device into a low power state. The purpose of this lab is meant to be a demonstration of low-power capability solely using software techniques. These techniques can be easily transferred to existing projects to enable low power using the xWR6843 and xWR6443 devices. 

*Note: This lab requires some familiarity with TI mmWave Sensors with regard to both software usage and device architecture.*

Low Power Software Techniques
===========

The included example project demonstrates low power capability by powering down various peripherals which leaves the device in a state resembling **Idle Mode**. While in these states various levels of functionality remain which is discussed below. 

All of these techniques are performed via software by the device R4F core. The corresponding function calls are included with libraries for:

* **mmWave-SDK 3.5**
* **mmWave-DFP 6.3** 
	* Version 6.3 is not yet provided on ti.com and the library is included with this project
* **LibSleep for 68xx/64xx devices**
	* This library is custom and is included with this project

[[b! For custom projects
These libraries must be added in order to custom projects in order to leverage these power reduction techniques. These libraries are included in the project **lib** folder.
]]

## Power Domain Techniques

The xWR6843 features a separate **DSP Power Domain** from the **Always-On Power Domain** as shown in the diagram below. It is not possible to directly manipulate the **Always-On Power Domain** for power consumption savings. Please see the [Technical Reference Manual](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/swru522e/swru522e.pdf#page=297) for more information on the device power domain. 

<img src="images/powerDomainDiagram.png" width="600" class="img-responsive"/>


###  Shut Down the DSP Power Domain
The integrated DSP utlizes a separate power domain from the rest of the xWR6843 device. As such it is possible to power down and clock gate the DSP power domain. This technique is highly preferred in applications where the DSP is not used. **Note: It is not possible to fully power the DSP back on without performing a hard reset to the device. This is also the only listed low-power component that cannot be powered back on at runtime.** 

This is achieved by calling the **xWR6843_dss_power_down()** function in the custom **libsleep_xwr68xx.aer4f** library and cannot be reversed without issuing a hard reset to the device.

## Digital Domain Techniques

Digital domain techniques revolve around clock gating each of the three device subsystems. Each of these clock gating components take about 10 microseconds to toggle making them the most versatile power saving techniques. Moreover any or all of the clock gates can be utilized depending on peripherals in use. There are varying levels of device functionality when clock gating, please see the device clock domain in the [Technical Reference Manual](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/swru522e/swru522e.pdf#page=291) for further details.

<img src="images/BlockDiagram.png" width="600" class="img-responsive"/>

### Clock Gate the DSP Sub-System (DSS)
For applications where the DSP might be needed sometimes, DSS clockgating represents a graceful alternative. While in this state the DSP is not active, it is possible to ungate the DSS clock and resume operation very quickly. This component allows L1 memory to be retained while still saving significant consumption off the DSP power domain.

This is achieved by calling the **xWR6843_dss_clock_gate()** function in the custom **libsleep_xwr68xx.aer4f** library and can be reversed by calling **xWR6843_dss_clock_ungate()**.

### Clock Gate the Master Sub-System (MSS)
This component slows MSS_VCLK by sourcing from the 40 MHz external crystal instead of the 200 MHz APLL. While saving significant power, this renders a majority of device peripherals non-operable. (Notable exceptions to this are the **CAN_FD** and **QSPI** peripherals which run on slower clock speeds.) One must also ungate the MSS_VCLK in order to resume normal device operation. While in this mode running timers and sequences will be slowed by a factor of 5. 

This is achieved by calling the **xWR6843_mss_vclk_40M()** function in the custom **libsleep_xwr68xx.aer4f** library and can be reversed by calling **xWR6843_mss_vclk_200M()**.

### Clock Gate the Radar Sub-System (BSS)
When analog peripherals are not needed the BSS can be clock gated and it is can be ungated very quickly. In this state not only the radar front-end, but also the other peripherals in the BSS block will be non-operable. ** This includes both of the Analog Domain Techinques listed below,** thus BSS clock-gating function must be called **after** both of the Analog Domain functions.

This is achieved by calling the **SOC_haltBSS()** function in the mmWave-SDK **libsoc_xwr68xx.aer4f** library and can be reversed by calling **SOC_unhaltBSS()**.

## Analog Domain Techniques
Analog domain techniques involve powering down two key analog peripherals, the Analog Front-End and the APLL. These are both invoked through the **mmWaveLink** call **rlSetPowerSaveModeConfig()** and are included in this example project. Each of these components take about 15 milliseconds to invoke and must be powered off/on in the order shown in the the diagram below. 

<img src="images/analogDiagram.png" width="600" class="img-responsive"/>

### Power Down the RF Analog Front-End (AFE)
This component gracefully powers down the Analog Front End resulting in significant power savings when the device is not needed for active chirping. The RF Power Down function sets the device into a similar state prior to where both **RF Init** and **RF Power-up** have been performed as in [mmWave Studio](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-STUDIO). Meanwhile performing AFE Power Up sets the device into a similar state where both RF steps have been performed.

This is achieved by calling the **rlSetPowerSaveModeConfig()** function in the **libmmwavelink_xwr68xx.aer4f** library with the input parameter
	* **lowPwrStateTransCmd** = 1

It can be reversed by calling the same **rlSetPowerSaveModeConfig()** function with the input parameter
	* **lowPwrStateTransCmd** = 2

### Power Down the APLL & GPADC
This component gracefully powers down the APLL resulting in significant power savings, though rendering nearly all of the device peripherals non-operable. Since all the other Sub-Systems utilize the APLL for clocking (e.g. DSS, MSS, & BSS), this function must be called last in a low-power/idle-mode scheme. 

#### Powering Down APLL Only

This is achieved by calling the **rlSetPowerSaveModeConfig()** function in the **libmmwavelink_xwr68xx.aer4f** library with the input parameter
	* **lowPwrStateTransCmd** = 3

It can be reversed by calling the same **rlSetPowerSaveModeConfig()** function with the input parameter
	* **lowPwrStateTransCmd** = 4

#### Powering Down APLL & GPADC 

Additionally there is an option to cut power to the GPADC engine for additional savings and sub-sequently powered on again. Note: The GPADC option has been tested but not validated for a variety of analog use-cases.

This is achieved by calling the **rlSetPowerSaveModeConfig()** function in the **libmmwavelink_xwr68xx.aer4f** library with the input parameter
	* **lowPwrStateTransCmd** = 5

It can be reversed by calling the same **rlSetPowerSaveModeConfig()** function with the input parameter
	* **lowPwrStateTransCmd** = 6

## Summary
There are varying levels of device functionality depending on the state 

Function                       | Domain Type                   | Software Library     | Functionality Limits
----------------------------|---------------------------|--------         |
DSP Power Domain Off  |Power   | libsleep_xwr68xx                    | No DSP functionality due to shutdown of DSP Specific Power Domain. Full device reset is required for to enable DSP power domain.
DSS Clock Gating      |Digital | libsleep_xwr68xx                    | No DSP functionality for duration of clock gating.  Functionality can be resumed by ungating DSP_CLK to 600 MHz.
MSS Clock Gating      |Digital | libsleep_xwr68xx                    | No Cortex CR4F functionality. Functionality can be resumed by ungating MSS_VCLK to 200 MHz. **Exception is for CAN_FD and QSPI peripherals which run on lower clock frequency.**
BSS Clock Gating      |Digital | mmWave-SDK (libsoc_xwr68xx.aer4f)         | No active chirping functionality of any kind. Functionality can be resumed by ungating BSS_CLK to 200 MHz.
RF Power Down         |Analog  | mmWave-DFP (libmmwavelink_xwr68xx.aer4f)  | No active chirping functionality of any kind. Functionality can be restored with DFP API.
APLL Power Down       |Analog  | mmWave-DFP (libmmwavelink_xwr68xx.aer4f)  | No active chirping functionality of any kind. Functionality can be restored with DFP API.
APLL/GPADC Power Down |Analog  | mmWave-DFP (libmmwavelink_xwr68xx.aer4f)  | No active chirping functionality of any kind. Functionality can be restored with DFP API.
                           
Idle Mode
===========

## What is Idle Mode?
This term refers to the sequence of low power functions used to set the device into an idle state. As few or as many of the functions can be used to make the idle mode scheme **but each must be invoked in appropriate order to ensure the device returns to an functional powered-on state.**

### Required function order for setting device into Idle Mode
The functions must be invoked in the following order to minimize the risk of running into modes.

* DSP Power Domain Off **OR** DSS Clock Gating
* MSS Clock Gating
* RF Power Down
* APLL Power Down **OR** APLL & GPADC Power Down
* BSS Clock Gating

### Required function order for bringing device out of Idle Mode
Subsequently the same peripherals must be powered on in reverse order to bring the device out of Idle Mode and into an appropriate functional state.

* BSS Clock Ungating 
* APLL Power Up **OR** APLL & GPADC Power Up
* RF Power Up
* MSS Clock Ungating
* DSS Clock Ungating (Note: It is currently not possible to power on the DSP Power Domain without providing a full reset to the device)

## Invoking Idle Mode in the 68xx Low Power Demo
Just as most of the mmWave Labs use CLI commands to run the sensor, Idle Mode is invoked in similar fashion with either of the commands **idlePowerCycle** or **idlePowerDown**.

  <img src="images/idlepowercommandexample.png" width="300"/>

### Idle Mode Commands

* **idlePowerCycle** runs each of the low power functions to power the device down into Idle Mode then, after a user-specified delay, powers the device back up into functional mode and ready to accept CLI Commands.
  * This command is useful when needing to confirm or determine device functionality.
* **idlePowerDown** runs each of the low power functions to power the device down into Idle Mode and leaves it there indefinitely. A hard reset to the device is required in order to provide power and resume functional mode. 
  * This command is useful when needing to confirm power figures.

### Idle Mode Parameters

Both of the commands **idlePowerDown** and **idlePowerCycle** use the following parameter structure `<subframeidx> <enDSPpowerdown> <enDSSclkgate> <enMSSvclkgate> <enBSSclkgate> <enRFpowerdown> <enAPLLpowerdown> <enAPLLGPADCpowerdown> <componentMicroDelay> <idleModeMicroDelay>`, where:
  * `<subframeidx>`: always set to -1 
  * `<enDSPpowerdown>`: 1 enables **DSP Power Domain Off**, 0 disables
  * `<enDSSclkgate>`: 1 enables **DSS Clock Gating**, 0 disables
  * `<enMSSvclkgate>`: 1 enables **MSS Clock Gating**, 0 disables
  * `<enBSSclkgate>`: 1 enables **BSS Clock Gating**, 0 disables (Note: Performed last at code level as discussed above)
  * `<enRFpowerdown>`: 1 enables **RF Power Down**, 0 disables
  * `<enAPLLpowerdown>`: 1 enables **APLL Power Down**, 0 disables
  * `<enAPLLGPADCpowerdown>`: 1 enables **APLL/GPADC Power Down**, 0 disables
  * `<componentMicroDelay>`: specifies a delay duration, in microseconds, between each successive power function
  * `<idleModeMicroDelay>`: specifies a delay duration, in microseconds, after Idle Mode has been acheived but before device is powered up (if using **idlePowerCycle**)

### Invoking Idle Mode

In this demo Idle Mode **must** be invoked after the sensor has started chirping (i.e. The mmWave_Open() function has been called). It can be called in one of two ways,

  * **UART Terminal**: By using a PC UART Terminal (e.g. PuTTY or Tera Term) and entering at CLI

  * **[mmWave Demo Visualizer](https://dev.ti.com/gallery/view/mmwave/mmWave_Demo_Visualizer)**: By connecting to the demo visualizer and sending either **idlePowerCycle.cfg** or **idlePowerDown.cfg** config files to the device.
 
The **mmWave Demo Visualizer** method is discussed below.

<a name="run_the_lab"></a>
4. Run the Lab
-----------

### 1. Start the Sensor

First, start sensor and begin object detection as discussed in the [68xx SDK Out-of-Box Demo User Guide.](../../../Out_Of_Box_Demo/docs/Out_Of_Box_Demo_User_Guide.html)

Note: Since this lab is HWA based, platform 64xx should be selected as below.

  <img src="images/64xx.png" width="500"/>



### 2. Invoke Idle Power via .cfg files

Next navigate to the **Plots** tab and click **LOAD CONFIG FROM PC AND SEND**. Then select the `idlePowerCycle.cfg` file. 



  <img src="images/loadconfig.png" width="600"/>



The device should enter Idle Mode which is indicated by the on-board LED turning off for about 1 second. The device will then be powered up in reverse order and the LED will turn on which indicates the device is functional again and ready to accept CLI commands.


#### Example Sequence

The default command `idlePowerCycle -1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1000000` performs the following sequence

  * DSP Power Domain Off 
  * MSS Clock Gating     
  * RF Power Down        
  * BSS Clock Gating     

  * Wait in Idle Mode for 1 second
  * BSS Clock Ungating 
  * RF Power Up
  * MSS Clock Ungating

]]

### 4. Execute the Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* **Deployment mode**: In this mode, the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Using Uniflash, flash the **68xx_low_power_demo.bin** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\68xx_low_power_demo\Debug\68xx_low_power_demo.bin`  
	* The procedure to flash the EVM is the same as detailed in the [Flash the EVM](#flash_the_evm) section. 
* **Debug mode**: This mode is is used for downloading and running the executable (.xer4f) from CCS. This mode enables JTAG connection with CCS while lab is running; useful during development and debugging
     
  
[[+d Expand for help with Debug mode:
The CCS debug firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) needs to be flashed once on the EVM. 
* CCS Debug method is enabled by flashing the CCS Debug Firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) using the methods covered in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#1-flash-the-evm) section.
* Use the following image instead

### 5. Stepping through the Idle Mode Functions

It may be useful to step through the Idle Mode functions using the debugger in order to observe the successive power reductions. 

To do this navigate to **main.c** where the functions **idle_power_down()** and **idle_power_cycle()** are run when the CLI commands **idlePowerDown** and **idlePowerCycle** are executed. Set a breakpoint at the start of the sequence (**GPIO_write()**) or the step of your choosing. The below example shows a breakpoint called at the function corresponding to **MSS Clock Gating.**

One can then step through the rest of the sequence using the debugger **Step Over (F6)** function.
