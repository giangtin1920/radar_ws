            mmWave Industrial Toolbox |  Latest                   |  [mmWave Industrial Toolbox installation instructions](../../../docs/readme.html)


        ### 2. Import Lab Project

            The mmWave SDK Out-of-box demo Lab CCS Project is available on TI
            Resource Explorer under mmWave Sensors &rarr; mmWave Industrial Toolbox.
            You can import the project in your CCS workspace using TI Resource 
            Explorer in CCS or by importing the projectspec from a local copy of
            the toolbox. Both methods of importing projects are defined below.
            To get started, open CCS and set up your workspace as desired. 

[[+d Expand for details on importing via TI Resource Explorer in CCS
    * In the top toolbar, navigate to **View &rarr; Resource Explorer** 
    * In the **Resource Explorer** side panel (not the main panel with "Welcome to.."),
         navigate to **Software &rarr; mmWave Sensors &rarr; Industrial Toolbox - &lt;ver&gt; &rarr; Labs &rarr;** 
    * Select the Out Of Box Demo, and then choose the appropriate project for
        your specific device or EVM
    * Click on the project, which should open the project in the right main 
        panel, and then click on the Import to IDE button
        <img src="../../../docs/images\import_ide_icon.png" width="40"/>.
+]]

[[+d Expand for details on importing via CCS Import Projectspecs
    * In the top toolbar, navigate to **Project &rarr; Import CCS Projects...**
    * With the **Select search-directory** option enabled, click **Browse...**,
        navigate to the **Out_Of_Box_Demo** folder at `C:\ti\<mmwave_industrial_toolbox_install_dir>\labs\Out_Of_Box_Demo\`
        and then click **OK**.    
    * Under **Discovered projects**, select the appropriate project for your device or EVM then click **Finish**. 
+]]
  
[[b! Project Workspace
    When importing projects to a workspace, a copy is created in the workspace.
    It is important to note that the copy in user's workspace is the one that
    gets built and all modifications will only be implemented for the workspace
    copy. The original project downloaded in mmWave Industrial Toolbox is not modified.
]]
  

        ### 3. Build the Lab

            #### **Build DSS Project**
                If the applicable demo for your device utilizes the DSP, then it
                will contain a DSS project as well as an MSS project the DSS project
                must be built before the MSS project.

                With the DSS  project selected in **Project Explorer**, right click
                on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. Selecting **Rebuild**
                instead of **Build** ensures that the project is always re-compiled.
                This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.
                
                Ensure that the DSS project builds without errors, which will be
                shown in the console window.

            #### **Build MSS Project**
                Select the MSS project in **Project Explorer**, right click on the
                project and select **Rebuild Project**.


[[r! Build Fails with Errors
    If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the [prerequisites](#software)
    are installed as mentioned in the previous steps.
]]

        ### 4. Execute the Lab
            There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
            * **Deployment mode**: In this mode, the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
                * Using Uniflash, flash the **.bin** file from the MSS project 
                    (typically in the **Debug** folder, but the folder name will 
                    depend on the project's configuration)
                * The procedure to flash the EVM is the same as detailed in the
                    [Flash the EVM](#flash_the_evm_using_uniflash) section. 
            * **Debug mode**: This mode is is used for downloading and running the
                executable (.xer4f and .xe674) from CCS. This mode enables JTAG connection
                with CCS while lab is running; useful during development and debugging. 
     

    ## CCS Debug Mode
        Follow the instructions for [Using CCS Debug for Development](../../../docs/software_guides/using_ccs_debug.html)
  

    ## Output from mmWave Demo Visualizer and Output using DCA1000EVM
        The mmWave Demo Visualizer is used to visualize processed output data
        from the mmWave radar device. This processed output data can be saved
        in binary form to a .DAT file. Additionally, raw ADC data can be saved 
        for offline processing using the [DCA1000 EVM](https://www.ti.com/tool/DCA1000EVM).
        To learn more about the structure of this output data please refer to the following resources:

[[b! Output Data versus Raw ADC Data
Output data refers to point cloud data (x,y,z,v). Raw ADC data refers to digitally sampled sensor data.
