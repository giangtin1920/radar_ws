Version 2.1.1
=============

Overview
========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors in an automated door application. Using the IWR6843, detection and tracking algorithms run onboard the device to localize people and track their movement with a high degree of accuracy. The visualizer simulates a door at the location of the sensor which will open when a person is 3 seconds away from reaching it. This lab also features a static object detection algorithm in order to sense non-human obstructions.

What's New
========
* Support for IWR6843AoPEVM
