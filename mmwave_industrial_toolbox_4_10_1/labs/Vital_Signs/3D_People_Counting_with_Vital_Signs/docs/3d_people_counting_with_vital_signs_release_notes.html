Version 1.0.0
=============

Overview
========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors to track and count people using the IWR6843AOPEVM sensor module  Detection and tracking algorithms run onboard the IWR6843 mmWave sensor and are used to localize people and track their movement. The tracking and localization is used to extract the data needed to process heart rate and breath rate measurements for 1 person.  The lab provides a binary image to demonstrate the functionality and runs on the TI mmWave sensor IWR6843.

Features
========

The following features are supported:
* Supports IWR6843AOP antenna module (ES2.0, Rev F or later).
* GUI displays point cloud and tracking information, plus vital sign measurements and waveforms
* Supports mmWave SDK 3.5

New and Updated Features
========================

This is the first release.
