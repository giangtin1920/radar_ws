Overview of 68xx Area Scanner 
===========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors for Area Scanner applications.
The range, velocity, and angle data from mmWave sensors can enable the detection of objects or people as they enter or exit zones of interest.  

Key features in this lab are the static detection and group tracking algorithms:
  * Typically it can be difficult to distinguish static objects of interest that have been left in an area from the static floor or fixtures that are also in the area. 
  Using the static detection algorithm enables the detection of static objects such as boxes, carts, or other equipment that have been left behind while ignoring the permanent static objects that comprise the scene. 
  * With group tracking, the sensor is able to gauge a moving object's trajectory and speed, enabling the area scanner system to predict before a safety zone is breached and to dynamically adjust the system's behavior depending on the object's speed of approach.  

The lab runs on the TI mmWave sensor IWR6843ISK, IWR6843ISK-ODS, or IWR6843AOP (Rev F+) EVM and includes a MATLAB visualizer.

Quickstart
===========

The quickstart guide will cover setting up the EVM, flashing firmware, and running the demo.

## 1. Setup the EVM for Flashing Mode
* For MMWAVEICBOOST + Antenna Module setup: Follow the instructions for [Hardware Setup for Flashing in MMWAVEICBOOST Mode](../../../docs/hardware_guides/evm_setup_operational_modes.html)
* For IWR6843ISK or IWR6843ISK-ODS in Standalone/Modular Mode: Follow the instructions for [Hardware Setup of IWR6843ISK/ODS for Flashing Mode](../../../docs/hardware_guides/evm_setup_operational_modes.html)
* For AOP in Standalone/Modular Mode: Follow the instructions for [Hardware Setup of IWR6843AOPEVM for Flashing Mode](../../../docs/hardware_guides/evm_setup_operational_modes.html)


## 2. Flash the EVM using Uniflash
 
Flash the binary listed below using UniFlash. Follow the instructions for [using UniFlash](../../../docs/software_guides/using_uniflash_with_mmwave.html)
 
 BIN Name                     | Board          | Location    
------------------------------|-----------------|-----------
area_scanner_68xx_demo_isk.bin| IWR6843ISK      |  `<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\area_scanner\`<br>`68xx_area_scanner\prebuilt_binaries\isk`
area_scanner_68xx_demo_ods.bin| IWR6843ISK-ODS  |  `<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\area_scanner\`<br>`68xx_area_scanner\prebuilt_binaries\ods`
area_scanner_68xx_demo_aop.bin| IWR6843AOPEVM  |  `<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\area_scanner\`<br>`68xx_area_scanner\prebuilt_binaries\aop`



## 3. Setup the EVM for Functional Mode
* For MMWAVEICBOOST + Antenna Module setup: Follow the instructions for [Hardware Setup of MMWAVEICBOOST + Antenna Module for Functional Mode](../../../docs/hardware_guides/evm_setup_operational_modes.html)
* For IWR6843ISK or IWR6843ISK-ODS in Standalone/Modular Mode: Follow the instructions for [Hardware Setup of IWR6843ISK/ODS for Functional Mode](../../../docs/hardware_guides/evm_setup_operational_modes.html)
* For AOP: follow the instructions for [Hardware Setup of IWR6843AOPEVM for Functional Mode](../../../docs/hardware_guides/evm_setup_operational_modes.html)

At this point, the EVM should be powered, connected to the PC, flashed with the demo, and put in functional mode. The hardware setup is now complete.

## 4. Run the Lab
### 1. EVM Mounting and Scene Conditions
The EVM should be mounted:
- Elevated 1m from the ground (mounting height)
- Oriented with the Z-axis towards the ceiling and the Y-axis pointed straight towards the scene of interest. (See EVM images at the top for orientation of axes)
- Tilted in elevation downwards 10 deg (&theta; = -10)

The static detection algorithm used in this lab records a scene calibration meausurement for the first 15 frames after the CFG file is loaded to the device.
This means the scene should be clear of "temporary" objects and people. The recorded calibration scene will be used to determine whether new static obejcts have entered the scene. 
If the "permanent" background scene changes or the sensor is moved, the calibration will need to be completed again. 

### 2. Launch the Visualizer

[[y! MATLAB Runtime Version R2019a (9.6)
**Exact version** R2019a (9.6) required. Download from: https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html
Other labs in the mmWave Industrial Toolbox may use version R2017a (9.2). For this lab, version R2019a (9.6) MUST also be installed. ]] 

* Navigate to `<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\area_scanner\68xx_area_scanner\gui`
* Double click to launch **area_scanner_visualizer.exe** 
* A black console window will appear. After 30-60sec, a setup window will appear as shown below.

### 3. Configure Visualizer 

<img src="images/as_setup_window.png" width="500" class="img-responsive"/>

**Visualizer Mode**
* Click the **Real Time** button
  * In Real Time mode the visualizer will connect to given COM ports and parse the incoming stream for visualization
  * In Play Back mode the visualizer will read in a txt file and enable a user to review the recorded byte stream from a real time session.
* Enter the COM ports associated with the mmWave EVM. 
  * Optional: Use **Test Connection** to ensure that COM ports are available and test command can be sent and received.

**Select CFG File**
* Use the **Browse** button to select the CFG file to load to the device or enter the full path and file name into the text field box.
  * To load the demo CFG file navigate to `..\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\area_scanner\68xx_area_scanner\chirp_configs` and select the **area_scanner_68xx_ISK_demo.cfg** or **area_scanner_68xx_ODS_demo.cfg** file for ISK or ODS boards respectively.

**Record Data**
* Check the **Enable recording.** option to record the UART stream to a text file for play back later on. Enabling this option will log the byte stream in HEX format to a text file.
* Specify the **Save Directory** and **File Name** of the log file.

NOTE: The record data feature will automatically create a text file with the name specified at the save directory. 
If there is already an existing file with the same name the file will be written over. Ensure path and\or file name are unique if this is not desired.

**Sensor Information**
* Sensor Mounting Height is the height of the EVM from the floor in meters
* Sensor Elevation tilt is the angle in degrees the sensor is tilted either upwards (+&theta;) towards the ceiling or downwards towards the floor (-&theta;)

**Visualizer Options**  
The options in this panel will determine the areas and behavior of the zone occupancy warning.
The demo defines two different regions:
* **Critical zone**: In this zone, the presence of any detected objects will trigger the zone to turn red. Use **Range Critical Zone Start** and **Range Critical Zone End** to specify in meters the radial distance from the sensor the region should start and end.
By default this is set to 0 to 2m. This means if there's any detected pt cloud or tracked object within 0-2m radially around the sensor - the zone will be triggered.
* **Warning zone**: In this zone, a moving, tracked object will trigger the zone to turn yellow if its current or or projected location is within the zone. Use **Range Warning Zone Start** and **Range Warning Zone End** to specify in meters the radial distance from the sensor the region should start and end. Typically, the critical zone end and warning zone start should be the same value.
* **Projection Time** is used to calculate the projected location of a tracked object. By default this is set at 2 seconds, meaning the object's location 2 seconds from the current time will be projected from it's velocity vectors and used in determining whether or not to trigger the warning zone indicator. A longer projection time will result in earlier warnings while a shorter projection time will give less warning time.

**Setup Complete**  
* Confirm that the scene is clear of any "temporary" objects. 
* When the scene is clear, click the **Setup Complete** button to confirm all the settings and send the config to the mmWave EVM. 
* The setup window will close and the main visualizer plot will open next.

NOTE: If the mmWave EVM was is currently running the new config file cannot be resent. The visualizer will instead open and attempt to continue parsing the incoming UART stream. To ensure that the intended CFG file can be loaded, toggle NRST on the EVM before clicking 'Setup Complete'. (This should have already been done when the EVM was returned to Functional Mode). 

### 4. Understanding the Visualizer Output

The window will open in a top-down, X-Y view of the scene.
NOTE: The data incoming from the sensor is relative to the sensor itself without consideration for its mounting position. 
The visualizer transforms and translates the points based on the input sensor information during setup. 
This is so Z = 0 on the plot correlates with the floor of the scene and the zones are defined on the same plane as the floor. 

<img src="images/as_understand_plot.png" width="600" class="img-responsive"/>

The visualizer will plot three types of detected object data:  
* **Static Point Cloud** is represented by magenta squares and is the output of the static detection processing. 
  * The point cloud represents newly added static objects to the scene. The primary aim of this detection chain is to detect whether objects such as boxes or carts have been left within the critical zone. 
  * The presence of static points in the critical zone will trigger the zone. 
  * Static points outside the critical zone are plotted for visualization purposes but do NOT trigger the warning zone. This is because the warning zone is primarily concerned with objects that can move into the critical zone. 
* **Dynamic Point Cloud** is represented by cyan points and is the output of the traditional range-doppler processing chain (same processing chain as the Out of Box demo from the prerequisite section).
  * Since the CFG file has static clutter removal enabled, the point cloud only shows detections for moving objects.
* **Tracked Objects** are the output of the GTRACK algorithm and are represented by white circles with a number inside for the tracked object's ID number. The dynamic point cloud is fed as input to the tracking algorithm which groups and tracks points across the scene.
  * Each tracked object will also have a projection line starting from its current position and ending at its projected position. The color of the line represents whether the projected position is in the critical zone (red), warning zone (yellow), or neither (green). 
  * A longer projection line indicates the tracked object is moving faster while a shorter projection line indicates the tracked object is slower moving. 

To end the visualizer session, exit out using the "X" in the upper right corner. If Record Data was enabled this will also close the text file and end recording. 
The visualizer saves the settings from the setup window and relaunching the visualizer will prepopulate any fields with the same values from the previous session.

### 5. Replay Data:

<img src="images/as_setup_window_replay.png" width="400" class="img-responsive"/>

  * Relaunch the visualizer
  * Select **Play Back** mode
  * Browse to and select the the .txt data file to load
  * Browse to and select the CFG file used when the data was collected. 
  * Input the Sensor Information parameters. They should match what was used when the data was collected.
  * The Visualizer Options can change for play back if desired.

In addition to plotting the data coming from the mmWave EVM, the visualizer also draws reference lines to indicate the approximate azimuth and elevation field of view (FOV) of the sensor. 
Using the drop down menu in the left corner, users can switch to other views of the scene. 
A useful view is the 2D, Y-Z view of the scene which gives an indicator of how the mounting height and down tilt affects the min and max detectable range of the sensor given the narrower elevation FOV.
The image below is from using the visualizer in play back mode to examine the Y-Z view. The view shows how the lower elevation FOV guideline intersects with the ground, marking the boundary for minimum detectable range. 
Outside the guide lines, the antenna gain is below a threshold at which detection of objects can be difficult. When debugging missed detections it's important to consider the effect of sensor placement and mounting.

]] 
  


### 3. Build the Lab

[[b! Note
The same lab projectspec is provided to support either the ISK, ODS, or AOP evm. Users can control which EVM to build for by setting the Active Build Configuration as shown below.
]]

1. Select the **area_scanner_68xx_mss** so it is highlighted. Right click on the project and select **Build Configurations** --> **Set Active** --> **isk** or **ods** or **aop** based on the EVM
2. Select the **area_scanner_68xx_dss** so it is highlighted. Right click on the project and select **Build Configurations** --> **Set Active** --> **isk** or **ods** or **aop** based on the EVM 
3. Select the **area_scanner_68xx_mss** so it is highlighted. Right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. The DSS project will automatically build first and then the MSS project. 
4. On successful build, the following should appear:
	* **ISK:**
		* In area_scanner_68xx_dss\isk, **area_scanner_68xx_dss_isk.xe674** (this is the C67x binary used for CCS debug mode) 
		* In area_scanner_68xx_mss\isk, **area_scanner_68xx_mss_isk.xer4f** (this is the Cortex R4F binary used for CCS debug mode) and **area_scanner_68xx_demo_isk.bin** (this is the flashable binary used for deployment mode)
	* **ODS:**
		* In area_scanner_68xx_dss\ods, **area_scanner_68xx_dss_ods.xe674** (this is the C67x binary used for CCS debug mode) 
		* In area_scanner_68xx_mss\ods, **area_scanner_68xx_mss_ods.xer4f** (this is the Cortex R4F binary used for CCS debug mode) and **area_scanner_68xx_demo_ods.bin** (this is the flashable binary used for deployment mode) 	
	* **AOP:**

		* In area_scanner_68xx_mss\aop, **area_scanner_68xx_mss_aop.xer4f** (this is the Cortex R4F binary used for CCS debug mode) and **area_scanner_68xx_demo_aop.bin** (this is the flashable binary used for deployment mode) 	


[[b! Note
Please set same Active Build Configuration for both MSS and DSS project. 
]]

{{y Selecting Rebuild instead of Build ensures that the project is always re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.}}

[[r! Build Fails with Errors
If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the software requirements are installed as listed above and in the mmWave SDK release notes.
]]

[[b! Note
As mentioned in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section, pre-built binary files, both debug and deployment binaries are provided in the pre-compiled directory of the lab.
]]

### 4. Execute the Compiled Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* **Deployment mode**: In this mode, the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Use the **area_scanner_68xx_demo.bin**  found at `<CCS_PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\area_scanner_68xx_mss\[Build-Folder]\` and follow the same process in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section except flash this binary instead.   
* **Debug mode**: This mode is is used for downloading and running the executable from CCS. This mode enables JTAG connection with CCS while the lab is running and is useful during development and debugging.
    * Follow the [CCS Debug Mode Guide](../../../docs/software_guides/using_ccs_debug.html), using the binaries listed below where EVM type correlates to the selected build configuration .
	 * After CCS Debug mode is setup, launch the visualizer and proceed as described in the [Run the Lab section of the Quickstart](#4-run-the-lab)  
	 
Debug binary   | Location | Connect and load to 
---------------|----------------------|----------------------
area_scanner_68xx_dss_evm type.xe674  |  `<CCS_PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\area_scanner_68xx_dss\<EVM-TYPE>\`   | C674X_0  
area_scanner_68xx_mss_evm type.xer4f  |  `<CCS_PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\area_scanner_68xx_mss\<EVM-TYPE>\`   | Cortex_R4_0

     

-----------
     
Work with GUI source code
-----------
{{y Working with and running the visualizer source files requires a full MATLAB license not just the MATLAB Runtime Engine}}

* The visualizer source files are located at `<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\area_scanner\68xx_area_scanner\gui`
* Running area_scanner_visualizer.m results in the same fucntionality as the executable used inthe Quick Start section; please refer to the section for details.
* Files of interest:
  * area_scanner_visualizer.m: Main visualizer script that calls the setup, parsing, and plotting functions. 
  * readUARTToBuffer.m: Copies any bytes available on the serial port object to a buffer in the Matlab workspace
  * parseBytes: Receives the buffer and parses bytes into an output struct representing the data in the frame.
 
Data Output Format
-----------
Output packets with the detection information are sent out every frame through the UART. 
Each packet consists of a Frame Header as shown below and a possibly variable number of TLV items containing various demo information. 
Each TLV item consists of type, length, and payload information. 
Since the length of the packet depends on the number of dynamic points, static points, and tracked objects it can vary from frame to frame. 
The end of the packet is padded so that the total packet length is always multiple of 32 Bytes.

### Headers
#### Frame Header   

Length: 44 Bytes  
A Frame Header is sent at the start of each packet. Use the Magic Word to find the start of each packet.

### Type Length Values (TLVs) 
The number of TLVs in a given packet is extracted from the Frame Header. For each TLV,
there is a TLV Header containing Type and Length information. The Length value gives the length of the payload. 
The payload should be parsed according to the appropriate Type identifier as listed in the tables below:
