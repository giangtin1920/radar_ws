Version 2.2.0
=============

**NOTE**: Due to the ongoing social distancing guidelines and TI policies, the scope of testing for this release was limited to 1-2 person tests. The underlying algorithm and implementation should be able to detect and track 5-7 people in the given coverage area but those tests are deferred for future releases once the guidelines allow for them.


Overview
========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors to track and count people using the IWR6843ISK, IIWR6843ISK-ODS or IWR6843AOPEVM sensor module positioned in side-mount configuration (e.g. on a wall). Detection and tracking algorithms run onboard the IWR6843 mmWave sensor and are used to localize people and track their movement.The lab provides full source code and a CCS project and runs on the TI mmWave sensor IWR6843.

Features
========

The following features are supported:
* Supports IWR6843ISK-ODS antenna module (ES2.0)
* Supports IWR6843AOP antenna module (ES2.0, Rev F or later).
* GUI displays point cloud and tracking information
* Supports mmWave SDK 3.5

New and Updated Features
========================

The following features are new or updated in this release:

* Track retention for stationary people
 * Previous versions of the tracking algorithm would delete tracks of people after some time if they sat down or stopped moving. This version upgrades the detection and tracking layers to maintain tracks even when sitting, lying, standing, or generally staying still.
 

* **Documentation update:** The following new documents covering People Counting demo software implementation, Detection and Tracker layer parameter tuning, and Tracker algorithm and implementation details have been released in labs\people_counting\docs directory.

    1. 3D_people_counting_demo_implementation_guide.pdf
    2. 3D_people_counting_detection_layer_tuning_guide.pdf
    3. 3D_people_counting_tracker_layer_tuning_guide.pdf
    4. Tracking_radar_targets_with_multiple_reflection_points.pdf

* Updated config files to make boundaryBox and staticBoundaryBox parameters consistent. Also added presenceBoundaryBox configuration (this feature was already supported in code). 

Resolved Incident Reports
=========================

The following are Incident Reports resolved in this release:
* N/A

Known Issues
============

The following are Known Issues in this release:
* Device must be restarted for reconfiguration.
* Elevation Angle Estimation on ISK may be inaccurate compared to ODS due to lower elevation angular resolution provided by ISK
* Static Tracking within 2 meters of the device can be obscured by false static detections.
* High speed targets may not be detected.

Work Arounds for Major Known Issues
===================================

The following are workarounds for each known issue with a major severity that exists in this release:
* Ensure the staticBoundaryBox argument for NearY is 2 or greater.

Limitations
=========================

The following is a list of known limitations for this release that were known at the time of release:

* Due to the ongoing social distancing guidelines and TI policies, the scope of testing for this release was limited to 1-2 person tests. The underlying algorithm and implementation should be able to detect and track 5-7 people in the given coverage area but those tests are deferred for future releases once the guidelines allow for them.
