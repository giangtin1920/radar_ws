/** Detail description of feature extraction module
 *
 *  The module provide a tool to extract a defined set of features from radar detected point cloud
 *  from low level signal processing chain (range, doppler, angle -- currently azimuth only, and 
 *  SNR estimation), as well as information from the tracking modules (position, velocity, acceleration, 
 *  tracker variance matrix and gating function etc). It assumes tracker always runs after the detection, 
 *  and detected points are localized to different tracks representing different objects within the scene.
 *
 *  The supported source for feature extraction:
 *  - Point cloud information
 *  - Track information
 *
 * For features from point cloud, only the following categories are supported
 *  - Range: from input (x, y) estimation 
 *  - Doppler: from input doppler estimation
 *
 * For each point cloud categories (range or doppler), all following 8 types of features will be extracted:
 *  - Center of mass (CoM) types, 2: mean and standard deviation (std). For each frame, and for each track/object, 
 *    CoM calculation is done using range/doppler estimation of point cloud associated with the track, and using 
 *    linear SNR estimation as the weight. Then mean or std is calculated from a configurable number of frames, defined in
 *    \ref RADARDEMO_featExtract_config.
 *  - envelope types, 5 total: bandwidth(BW), offest and torso bandwidth(torsoBW), as defined by Kim and Ling's paper 
 *    "Human Activity Classification Based on Micro-Doppler Signatures Using a Support Vector Machine"
 *    For each frame, and for each track/objec, an upper envelope and lower envelope of the signal is calculated as the max of the 
 *    signal and min of the signal. Then the BW, offest and torsoBW calculated from a a configurable number of frames as following:
 *       BW      = max(upperEnv) - min(lowerBW)
 *       offest  = mean(upperEnv) - mean(lowerBW)
 *       torsoBW = min(upperEnv) - max(lowerBW)
 *    As well as 
 *       peak to average ratio of upper envelope
 *       peak to average ratio of lower envelope
 *  - Histogram of the signal dispersion, hist(signal - centerOfMass). This is done per frame per object, and accumulated along frames. 
 *
 * For features from tracker, only the following categories are supported
 *  - Position (Pos) 
 *  - Velocity (Vel)
 *  - Acceleration (Accel)
 *  - EC matrix
 *  - G factor
 *
 * For each tracker categories (pos etc), all following 4 types statistics will be extracted:
 *  - Minimum, maximum, mean, std: For each frame, and for each track/object, the corresponding track information will be stored.
 *    Then min/max/mean/std can be calculated from a configurable number of frames.
 *
 * In the implementation, this module is configured, and executed per track/object. 
 *
 * The feature category is described in \ref RADARDEMO_featExtract_featDescr, must have one descriptor per feature category.
 * This feature descriptor, along with other parameters such as blkLen etc are part of \ref RADARDEMO_featExtract_config. 
 *
 * Input structure contains per track point cloud and tracker information, \ref RADARDEMO_featExtract_input.
 *
 * For each feature category described in RADARDEMO_featExtract_featDescr in the configuration, the module will extract all the features/statistics
 * associated to the feature category, and stores in the output structure.
 *
 * Output structure contains output features, they are arrange in the same order as defined feature decriptors in the configuration, 
 * and stored in the buffer that can be indexed by the feature selection Index defined in \ref RADARDEMO_featExtract_pntCloudFeatsIdx 
 * and \ref RADARDEMO_featExtract_featStatIdx. User can select subset of the features for classification.
 * 
 * There are a set of utility functions provided in RADARDEMO_featExtrUtil_priv.c function for feature extractions, including 
 * calculation of center of mass, min, max, mean, std and histogram of dispersion. If features provided in this RADARDEMO_featExtraction 
 * does not meet the user's need, the user can leverage these utility functions to calculate their own feature set.
