 *  \brief   Reduce complexity Eigen Value Decomposition, to get extreme eigen value and corresponding eigen vector, based on Jonathon Manton's iterative 
 *           method based on as explained in http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=00955263. Input parameter "Tolerance" is used as the stoping 
 *           criteria of this iterative method. Choosing the Tolrence decides the precision of the eigen values and thereofore the performance of the loop
 *           (i.e. number of Manton's iteration). User has to do performance analysis with different tolerance values to get the required precision.
 *           Input, scratch buffer and output arrays must be aligned on a double word (8-byte) boundary using DATA_ALIGN pragma. 
 *
 *  \param[in]    A_Mat
 *              Input Complex Hermitian Matrix of dimension matSize X matSize. All elements of the Matrix A_Mat are stored in 1-d array row-wise format. 
 *              Storage requirement for this array is =  2*4*matSize*matSize bytes. To avoid cache penalties it is recommended to warm-up L1D cache with 
 *              A_Mat using touch() loop. A_Mat must be aligned on the 8 byte boundary using DATA_ALIGN pragma.
 *              Below formula will help visualize how A_Mat(row, column) complex Hermitian single precision floating-point matrix of size N is stored in memory.
 *              For example i represents row and j represents column and the 1-d array float variable is A_mat[2*N*N]. So row 1 of A_Mat is stored is A_mat[0 : 2*N-1],
 *              2nd row of A_Mat is stored in A_mat[2*N:4*N-1] and Mth row of A_Mat is stored in A_mat[2*N*M : 2*N*M + 2*N - 1].
 *
 *  \param[in]    sctrachBufPtr
 *              The scratchpad memory needed for intermediate data storage. This array must be aligned on the 8-byte boundary using DATA_ALIGN pragma. 
 *              Storage requiement for this array is = (4*matSize*matSize + 6*matSize)*4 bytes, where matSize is the size of the matrix.
 *
 *  \param[in]    size
 *              It contains Matrix size. For 8x8 Matrix, size variable equals to 8.
 *
 *  \param[in]    Tolerance
 *              Tolerance specify the minimum threshold needed for the residual error calculated in the algorithm and used as stopping criteria for the Manton's iterations
 *              to approximate extreme Eigen vector. Based on the performance analysis in MATLAB to get precision accurate to at least 2 decimal digit tolerance needs to be 
 *              0.01. MATLAB code is also checked-in to the library for the user to play with the desired precision and decide tolerance as well as maximum number of iterations.
 *
 *  \param[out]    eigenValPtr
 *              Pointer to the extreme eigen value variable.
 *
 *  \param[in,out] eigenVectPtr
 *              The pointer to the array where Eigen vector, of size equals to  1 X matSize, for the extreme Eigen value is stored. eigenVectorPtr complex array needs
 *              to be pre-initialized with all zeros except the real part of the first element. Real part of the first element needs to be initialized with 1.0. 
 *              This is the initial estimate of the eigenvector of the corresponding extreme Eigen value of the matrix and Manton's iteration method iterated to converge
 *              to the actual complex eigenvectors. It is recommended to warm-up the cache to take advantage of the writeback cache. This array needs to be aligned on the
 *              8 byte boundary.
 *   
 *  \param[in,out] iteration
 *              Input: Maximum iteration allowed for a given performance and precision.
 *              Output: Total number of iterations executed by the Manton's algorithm for a given precision (based on tolerance parameter).
 *
 *  \pre      eigenVectorPtr complex array needs to be pre-initialized with all zeros except the real part of the first element. Real part of the first element needs 
 *            to be initialized with 1.0. This is the initial estimate of the eignevector of the corresponding extreme eigenvalue of the matrix and Manton's iteration method  
 *            iterated to converge to the actual complex eigenvectors.
