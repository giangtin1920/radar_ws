 *  \brief   This is inplace implementation of Modified Jacobian Method for Eigen Value Decomposition of Hermitian symmetric and positive definite matrix in floating-point. 
 *           It also works for non-positive definite as long as it is Hermitian symmetric. For Hermitian symmetric matrix A, this function decomposes A into V*D*V' by doing 
 *           sequence of Givens rotations to minimize off-diagonal norm of the matrix:  where V is the eigenvector matrix and D is the diagonal matrix of Eigen values. Input 
 *           parameter "Tolerance" is used as the limit for the off-diagonal norm of the matrix calculated after every Givens rotations. Choosing the Tolerance decides the 
 *           precision of the Eigen values and therefore the performance of the loop (i.e. number of iterations). User has to do performance analysis with different tolerance
 *           values to get the required precision using the matlab project at "../unittest/matlab".
 *
 *  \param[in]    matrixSize
 *                Matrix size, for 8x8 Matrix, matrixSize variable equals to 8. This implementation is optimized for upto 8x8 matrix.
 
 *  \param[in]    tolerance
 *                Input parameter "Tolerance" is used as the stopping criteria for the sequence of Givens rotations in the Jacobian methods as it is used as limit for the 
 *                off-diagonal norm calculated after every rotation. Tolerance value decides the precision needed for the generated Eigen values and therefore the performance 
 *                of the loop (i.e. number of Givens rotations). 
 
 *  \param[in,out] eigenValPtr
 *                 This is input as well as output parameter. Input is the Complex Hermitian matrix of dimension size X size. Output is all diagonal matrix of eignevalues. 
 *                 All elements of the Matrix A_Mat are stored in 1-d array row-wise. Storage requirement for this array is = 2*4*size*size bytes. 
 *                 The 1-d arrays must be aligned on the 8 byte boundary using DATA_ALIGN pragma. 
 *                 Below formula will help visualize how A_Mat(row, column) complex Hermitian single precision floating-point matrix of size N is stored in memory.
 *                 For example i represents row and j represents column and the 1-d array float variable is A_mat[2*N*N]. So row 1 of A_Mat is stored is A_mat[0 : 2*N-1],
 *                 2nd row of A_Mat is stored in A_mat[2*N:4*N-1] and Mth row of A_Mat is stored in A_mat[2*N*M : 2*N*M + 2*N - 1].
 * 
 * 
 *  \param[in,out] eigenVectMatPtr
 *                 The pointer to Eigen vector matrix stored as 1-D array row-wise. This array pointer needs to be aligned on the 8 byte boundary. It is recommended to 
 *                 warm-up the cache with these values to avoid any cache penalties. Note that 1-d array pointed by eigenVectPtr needs to be pre-initialized with identity
 *                 matrix (I) of same size. This can be done by calling library function MATRIX_EVDFloat_init() function.
 *  
 *  \param[in,out] iteration
 *                  Input: Maximum iteration allowed for a given performance and precision.
 *                  Output: Total number of iterations executed by the Jacobian method to get the desired precision for the off-diagonal norm specified by Tolerance.
 *
 *  \pre      eigenVectMatPtr array matrixr needs to be pre-initialized with identity matrix of size equal to matrixSize. This can be done by calling MATRIX_EVD_init() function.
 *            eigValPtr and eigenVectMatPtr array pointers must be aligned on a double word (8-byte) boundary using DATA_ALIGN pragma.
