Overview
===========

The IWR6443 Long Range People Detection lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors to count and track multiple people simultaneously up to 50m away. Algorithms run on board the IWR6443 sensor to process radar data, then detect people using the processed data. Static objects, such as trees, signs, and buildings are ignored. This enables user's to implement robust human detection and tracking into their systems, improving reliability of automated systems.

**NOTE**: This version of the Long Range People Detection demo is compatible with both the IWR6443 and IWR6843, as it only uses the on-chip Hardware FFT acclerator (HWA) and does not utilize the on-chip c674x DSP. This demo is originally tested on the IWR6843ISK EVM but the demo is compatible with the both the IWR64xx and IWR68xx devices.

Performance Expectation
=======================

The lab comes with 3 default chirps. These are
  * 2D 50 meter - 50 meter range with 10 Hz update rate, good for tracking people - slightly higher detection range compared to 3D
  * 3D 50 meter - 50 meter range with 10 Hz update rate and 3 dimensional cartesian data. Good in areas with multiple elevations.
  * 2D 100 meter - 100 meter range at 2.5 Hz implementing beamforming to increase range. Due to hardware limitations, this chirp has slightly less range than the IWR6843 version.

You can see a performance comparison in the charts below. The 2D and 3D 50 meter chirps will have very similar performance, but the 2D chirp has more chirps per virual reciever, which leads to the higher measure range values below.  The Tx Beamforming chirp uses all 3 Tx in each chirp, so it is limited to 2D. Unlike the 50 meter chirps, the beamforming chirp has much more consistent range across its FOV as the radiation pattern is directed in each direction during the duration of the chirp.

Beamforming is described in detail in the [user's guide for IWR6843 Long Range People Detection](../../68xx_long_range_people_det/docs/6843_long_range_people_detection_user_guide.html). Please see details there to understand how to modify beamforming chirp configurations.

Quickstart
===========

1. Hardware and Software Requirements
-----------
### Hardware

 Item                     | Details     
--------------------------|-----------------
  Device                  |  [IWR6443 Long Range Antenna Board](http://www.ti.com/tool/IWR6843ISK) and ooptional [Industrial mmWave Carrier Board](http://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVEICBOOST).
  Mounting Hardware       |  The EVM needs to be mounted at a height of ~2.0-2.5m with a slight downtilt. An [adjustable clamp style smartphone adapter mount for tripods](https://www.amazon.com/Vastar-Universal-Smartphone-Horizontal-Adjustable/dp/B01L3B5PBI/) and a [60-75" tripod](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Portable-centimeters-Camcorder-kilograms/dp/B01N6JCW8F/) can be used to clamp and elevate the EVM. This is only an example solution for mounting; other methods can be used so far as setup specifications are met.
  Computer                |  PC with Windows 10. If a laptop is used, please use the 'High Performance' power plan in Windows.
  Micro USB Cable         |  Due to the high mounting height of the EVM, an 8ft+ cable or USB extension cable is recommended.
  Power Supply            |  5V, 3A with 2.1-mm barrel jack (center positive). The power supply can be wall adapter style or a battery pack with a USB to barrel jack cable.

3. Physical Setup
-----------  
1. Follow the instructions for [Hardware Setup of ISK for Functional Mode](../../../../docs/hardware_guides/evm_setup_operational_modes.html)

2. For best results, the EVM should be positioned high enough to be above the top of tracked objects and with a slight down tilt. 
The aim is to position the EVM so that the antenna beam can encompass the area of interest. 
If the down tilt is too severe, noise from ground clutter would increase and the effective sensing area would decrease. 
If threre is no down tilt, counting performance would be worse for cases in which one person is in line with and shielded by another person.
Given the antenna radiation pattern of the EVM, consideration should be taken to not mount the EVM too close or oriented with beam directed to the ceiling as this can increase the noise floor and result in less optimal performance.
<img src="images/downtilt.jpg" width="700"/>

**Setup Requirements:**
* Elevate EVM: 2.0-2.5m high 
* Down tilt: ~2-3 degree 

**Setup using suggested tripod and smartphone clamp mount:**
1. Screw on clamp mount to tripod 
2. Clamp EVM across its width below power barrel jack to attach EVM
3. Adjust tripod head for ~2-3 degree down tilt (Tip: Bubble or level smartphone apps can be used to measure down tilt)
4. Plug in micro-usb and power supply to EVM 
5. Extend tripod so that the EVM is elevated 2.0-2.5m from the ground
6. Position EVM and tripod assembly in desired location of room. The EVM should be positioned so that the 120 degree FOV of the EVM antenna encompasses the area of interest and points to the region in which people are expected to enter the space.

### 2. Import Lab Project

For the People Counting lab, there are two projects, the DSS for the C674x DSP core and the MSS project for the R4F core, that need to be imported to CCS and compiled to generate firmware for the xWR6843.

[[b! Project Workspace
When importing projects to a workspace, a copy is created in the workspace. All modifications will only be implemented for the workspace copy. The original project downloaded in mmWave Industrial Toolbox is not touched.
]]

1. Start CCS and setup workspace as desired. 
2. Import the project(s) specified below to CCS. See instructions for importing [here](../../../../docs/readme.html#import-ccs-projects-from-the-mmwave-industrial-toolbox-into-code-composer-studio).
   * **long_range_people_det_64xx_mss** 
3. Verify that the import occurred without error: in CCS Project Explorer, **long_range_people_det_64xx_mss** should appear.
  

### 3. Build the Lab

The DSS project must be built before the MSS project.
1. Select the  **long_range_people_det_mss** so it is highlighted. Right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. The MSS project will build, the the lab binary will be constructed automatically.
2. On successful build, the following should appear: 
    * In long_range_people_det_mss &rarr; Debug, **long_range_people_det_64xx_mss.xer4f** (this is the Cortex R4F binary used for CCS debug mode) and **long_range_people_det_64xx_demo.bin** (this is the flashable binary used for deployment mode) 

{{y Selecting Rebuild instead of Build ensures that the project is always re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.}}

[[r! Build Fails with Errors
If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the software requirements are installed as listed above and in the mmWave SDK release notes.
]]

[[b! Note
As mentioned in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section, pre-built binary files, both debug and deployment binaries are provided in the pre-compiled directory of the lab.
]]


### 4. Execute the Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* Deployment mode: the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Using Uniflash, flash the **long_range_people_det_64xx_demo.bin** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\long_range_people_det_64xx_mss\Debug\long_range_people_det_64xx_demo.bin`  
  * The same procedure for flashing can be use as detailed in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#flash_the_evm) section. 
* Debug mode: Follow the instructions for [Using CCS Debug for Development](../../../../docs/software_guides/using_ccs_debug.html)
     

After executing the lab using either method, the lab can be visualized using the [Quick Start GUI](#run_gui_quickstart) or continue to working with the [GUI Source Code](../../../People_Counting/visualizer/docs/people_counting_visualizer_user_guide.html)

Data Formats
----------- 

A TLV(type-length-value) encoding scheme is used with little endian byte order. For every frame, a packet is sent consisting of a fixed sized **Frame Header** and then a variable number of TLVs depending on what was detected in that scene. The TLVs can be of types representing the point cloud, target list object, and associated points.

<img src="images/packet_structure.png" width="600"/>

### Frame Header
Size: 52 bytes

```Matlab
frameHeaderStructType = struct(...
    'magicWord',                {'uint64', 8}, ... % syncPattern in hex is: '02 01 04 03 06 05 08 07'
