                        <p>The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the ability of TI mmWave sensor to detect very fine motion. This experiment demonstrates that TI mmWave is not only able to detect major motions such as a person walking or moving their arms but can also detect very fine movements such as typing and even breathing. Furthermore, fine motion detection in environmental conditions of darkness or smoke, which can be respectively challenging for cameras or PIR sensors was also evaluated. This experiment has two parts:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Normal conditions for a conference room: The experiment was performed under normal environmental conditions in a small conference room. The response of the mmWave sensor EVM to different types of motion at various distances was captured and compared to the response of a PIR based motion sensor installed in the room.</li>
                            <li>Living room under darkness or smoke: The experiment was performed in a living room with smart lighting. The EVM and a PIR sensor were each mounted in the room and used to control a smart light bulb. The effect of total darkness and smoke on the response of the EVM and PIR sensor to fine motions were then compared. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The setup for this experiment can be divided into two parts, namely physical setup and software setup.</p>
                        <h2 id="-physical-setup-">Physical Setup</h2>
                        <p>The physical setup includes information about the scene such as the distance between the target and the sensor antenna, the type of target used, hardware setup and any other physical considerations e.g. non-reflective surfaces or use of anechoic chamber etc.</p>
                        <p>The physical setup used for <u>Part 1: Normal Conditions for a Conference room</u>:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Tests were conducted in a small conference room with dimensions of 4.40 m x 5.12 m x 2.73 m (width x depth x height).</li>
                            <li>An IWR1443 EVM was mounted in one of the corners of the conference room using a tripod as shown in the picture below. The EVM was mounted at a sufficient height and was tilted downwards to maximize the coverage area in the field of view of the sensor.</li>
                            <li>
                                A PIR based motion sensor integrated with the light switch in the conference room was used as a reference for all measurements.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The motion sensor has LED outputs which light on when motion is detected.</li>
                                    <li>It was ensured that the motion sensor had a direct view of the target in all cases.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>The human target moved to different locations in the conference room as shown in Figure 3.</li>
                            <li>Unless otherwise noted, the target was always in direct view of the mmWave sensor, i.e. there were no physical obstructions between the target and the sensor.</li>
                            <li>
                                <p>For the purpose of this experiment, the motions of interest are defined as following:</p>

                                        <p>Major motion: Person walking, Arm movement, etc.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Using the IWR1443 and IWR1642 SDK Out-of-Box Demo, we were able to successfully detect Major, Fine and Very Fine motions (as defined above) in a conference room and a living room</li>
                            <li>mmWave is better than PIR for motion detection: For equivalent tests, the PIR motion sensor could detect only Major motions and was unable to detect Fine or Very Fine motions.</li>
                            <li><span>mmWave continued to detect Major, Fine and Very Fine motions in darkness and smoke without issue</span>.</li>
                            <li>The PIR sensor, even at high sensitivity could not detect fine motions or even the major type arm motion of grabbing and opening a laptop. Furthermore, the smoke used in this experiment was simulated using a fog machine. Smoke caused by a fire is associated with higher temperatures and particulate matter that may have further deleterious effects on PIR sensor.   </li>
                            <li>
                                The chirp configuration provided above represents one possible way to configure the sensor for this type of application. Advanced chirp designs, antenna designs and algorithms can provide better range and/or motion sensitivity.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>For example: A dual chirp design can be used with one chirp providing long range detection with lower velocity resolution and the second chirp with high velocity resolution at near range.</li>
                                    <li>The antenna onboard the IWR1443BOOST EVM has an Azimuth FOV (Field of View) of about 120 degrees and an elevation FOV of about 30 degrees. Custom antenna designs can be used to achieve wider FOVs in Azimuth and/or Elevation planes depending upon requirements.</li>
                                    <li>As an example of extreme motion sensitivity, the <a href="../labs/Vital_Signs/68xx_vital_signs/docs/vital_signs_68xx_Users_Guide.html">Vital Signs Demo</a> available on <a href="../labs/Vital_Signs/vitalSigns_landing.html">TI Resource Explorer</a> demonstrates the <span>usage of TI mmWave sensors to detect miniscule motions, such as displacement of the chest when the heart beats or the person breathes. The demo uses these miniscule displacements to measure the heart rate and breathing rate of a human subject.</span></li>
