                        <p>The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate the ability to detect gesture motions using a TI mmWave Sensor EVM through two impediments, glass and smoke. Two types of gesture motions were tested, a finger twirl motion and hand double swipe motion. Gestures were performed both without any impediment and then with the impediment introduced in between the sensor and the gestures. </p>
                        <h1 id="-setup-nbsp--"><strong>Setup </strong></h1>
                        <p>The setup for this experiment can be divided into two parts, namely physical setup and software setup. These are detailed below:</p>
                        <h2 id="-physical-setup-">Physical Setup</h2>
                        <p>The physical setup includes information about the scene such as the distance between the target and the sensor antenna, the type of target used, hardware setup and any other physical considerations e.g. non-reflective surfaces or use of anechoic chamber etc. The physical setup used for this experiment is given below:</p>
                        <p>The following cases were tested for each of the two gestures:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The experiment demonstrates that an IWR1443 mmWave sensor EVM is capable of gesture recognition with either glass or smoke as impediments between the sensor and the target hand making the gesture.</li>
                            <li>The impediments do degrade the signals used for gesture detection. However, the degree to which this affects gesture recognition capabilities can be tuned by considering sensor parameters as well gesture recognition algorithm parameters.</li>
