# Overview


    This guide is intended for users with a TI mmWave sensor evaluation module (EVM).
    The guide will walk through setting up the boards into either **Flashing Mode** or **Functional Mode**.
    In flashing mode, a program may be loaded onto the device's external flash.
    In functional mode, the EVM boots automatically from flash and begins executing 
    the image stored there. 

    This guide supports several different EVM's so be sure to follow the steps 
    that apply to your device.

# mmWaveICBoost Initial Configuration
    This section is only necessary if the EVM is being attached to an
    mmWaveICBoost carrier board and the carrier board has not been configured
    for flashing or functional mode previously.

[[+d Expand for steps for inital mmWaveICBoost Configuration
    ## Set S1 Switches
        Set the S1 switch combination as shown in the image below. This puts 
        the mmWaveICBoost in its standalone operation as opposed to in
        development mode for use with a DCA1000.

# ISK and ISK-ODS EVM's

        This section applies to the following boards:
            * [xWR6843ISK](http://www.ti.com/tool/IWR6843ISK)
            * [xWR6843ISK-ODS](http://www.ti.com/tool/IWR6843ISK-ODS)


    ## ISK Standalone Mode
        * This section describes setting an ISK or ISK-ODS EVM to Flashing or
            Functional mode when used **without** a mmWaveICBoost carrier board.
        * Only ISK Rev C or later and ISK-ODS Rev B or later can be
            used in standalone mode.
        * CCS Debug mode does **NOT** work in standalone mode.

[[+d Expand for steps for the Standalone ISK EVM's
        ### Hardware Requirements for Standalone ISK
            * ISK or ISK-ODS Antenna Module Board
            * Micro USB Cable


        ### Flashing Mode for Standalone ISK
            1. Set the mux switches as shown in the image below
                ![ISK_Mux_Flashing](images/ISK_And_ISK_ODS/isk_front_flashing.png)
            2. Connect the micro-USB cable to the EVM at the connector shown and
                then to a PC. Note that a separate power supply is not needed as
                the ISK and ISK-ODS modules get power from the USB connection
                itself. LEDs on the EVM should turn on.
                ![ISK_Connect_Cable](images/ISK_And_ISK_ODS/isk_cable.png)


        ### Functional Mode for Standalone ISK
            1. Set the mux switches as shown in the image below
                ![ISK_Mux_Flashing](images/ISK_And_ISK_ODS/isk_front_functional.png)
            2. Connect the micro-USB cable to the EVM at the connector shown and
                then to a PC. Note that a separate power supply is not needed as
                the ISK and ISK-ODS modules get power from the USB connection
                itself. LEDs on the EVM should turn on.

    ## ISK With mmWaveICBoost Attached
        This section describes setting an ISK or ISK-ODS EVM to Flashing or
        Functional mode when attached to an mmWaveICBoost carrier board.

[[+d Expand for steps for the ISK EVM's with an mmWaveICBoost
        ### Hardware Requirements for ISK + Carrier
            * [MMWAVEICBOOST Carrier Board](http://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVEICBOOST)
            * ISK or ISK-ODS Antenna Module Board
            * Micro USB Cable
            * Power Supply 5V, 3A with 2.1-mm barrel jack (center positive)


        ### Initial Configuration for ISK + Carrier

            1. Configure mmWaveIcBoost

                If the mmWaveICBoost carrier board has not been used previously,
                then follow the [steps to perform initial configuration of the
                carrier board.](#mmwaveicboost-initial-configuration)
            2. Configure Antenna Module

                On *newer* EVM's (ISK Rev C or later and ISK-ODS Rev B or Later)
                that have not been previously used in conjunction with the carrier 
                board, set the S1 Switches according to the following image
                ![ISK_EVM_Carrier_Mode_S1](images/ISK_And_ISK_ODS/isk_front_carrier_mode.png)
            3. Mount EVM

                * If using an older revision of the ISK or ODS module, both 60Pin
                    connectors will be used.
                * If using a newer revision of the ISK or ISK-ODS module, only
                    the right connector closer to the micro-usb connectors will 
                    be connected.
                ![ISK_Carrier](images/mmWaveICBoost/Carrier_Mounted_ISK_ODS.png) 
            4. Connect cables

                * Connect the micro-USB to the carrier board at the connector
                    shown and to the PC. Note that the micro-USB is connected
                    to the lower XDS110 USB (and not the FTDI USB).
                * Connect the 5V/3A power supply to the power source and then 
                    to the carrier board. LEDs on the carrier board should turn on.
                ![Carrier_Connect_Cables](images/mmWaveICBoost/carrier_connect_cables.png)


        ### Flashing Mode for ISK + Carrier
            Set SOP mode jumpers according to the following image to
            configure the carrier board for flashing mode. 
            ![Carrier_SOP_Flashing](images/mmWaveICBoost/carrier_sop_mode_flashing.png)


        ### Functional Mode for ISK + Carrier
            Set SOP mode jumpers according to the following image to
            configure the carrier board for functional mode.
