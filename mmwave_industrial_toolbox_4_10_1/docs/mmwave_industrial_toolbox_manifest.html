By contrast,<br>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>know their rights.<br><br>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br><br>  For the developers" and authors" protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users" and<br>authors" sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>authors of previous versions.<br><br>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>protecting users" freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br><br>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>  0. Definitions.<br><br>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br><br>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>works, such as semiconductor masks.<br><br>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br><br>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br><br>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>on the Program.<br><br>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br><br>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br><br>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br><br>  1. Source Code.<br><br>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>form of a work.<br><br>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>is widely used among developers working in that language.<br><br>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br><br>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work"s<br>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>subprograms and other parts of the work.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>Source.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>same work.<br><br>  2. Basic Permissions.<br><br>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br><br>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br><br>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>makes it unnecessary.<br><br>  3. Protecting Users" Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br><br>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>measures.<br><br>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work"s<br>users, your or third parties" legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>technological measures.<br><br>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br><br>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program"s source code as you<br>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br><br>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br><br>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>    it, and giving a relevant date.<br><br>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>    "keep intact all notices".<br><br>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br><br>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>    work need not make them do so.<br><br>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation"s users<br>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>parts of the aggregate.<br><br>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br><br>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>in one of these ways:<br><br>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br><br>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>    with subsection 6b.<br><br>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br><br>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>    charge under subsection 6d.<br><br>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>included in conveying the object code work.<br><br>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>the only significant mode of use of the product.<br><br>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>modification has been made.<br><br>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>been installed in ROM).<br><br>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>protocols for communication across the network.<br><br>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>unpacking, reading or copying.<br><br>  7. Additional Terms.<br><br>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br><br>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br><br>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br><br>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br><br>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br><br>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>    authors of the material; or<br><br>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br><br>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>    those licensors and authors.<br><br>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br><br>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>where to find the applicable terms.<br><br>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>the above requirements apply either way.<br><br>  8. Termination.<br><br>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>paragraph of section 11).<br><br>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br><br>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>your receipt of the notice.<br><br>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>material under section 10.<br><br>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br><br>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br><br>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br><br>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>licenses to the work the party"s predecessor in interest had or could<br>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br><br>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br><br>  11. Patents.<br><br>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>work thus licensed is called the contributor"s "contributor version".<br><br>  A contributor"s "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>this License.<br><br>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>patent license under the contributor"s essential patent claims, to<br>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br><br>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>patent against the party.<br><br>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>covered work in a country, or your recipient"s use of the covered work<br>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br><br>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>work and works based on it.<br><br>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br><br>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br><br>  12. No Surrender of Others" Freedom.<br><br>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br><br>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>combination as such.<br><br>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br><br>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy"s<br>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>to choose that version for the Program.<br><br>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>later version.<br><br>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br><br>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  16. Limitation of Liability.<br><br>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br><br>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br><br>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br><br>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>    <one line to give the program"s name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br><br>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>    (at your option) any later version.<br><br>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>    GNU General Public License for more details.<br><br>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br><br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br><br>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br><br>    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w".<br>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>    under certain conditions; type `show c" for details.<br><br>The hypothetical commands `show w" and `show c" should show the appropriate<br>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program"s commands<br>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br><br>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br><http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br><br>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br><http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.<br><br><br>                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br><br> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br><br>  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br><br>  0. Additional Definitions.<br><br>  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>General Public License.<br><br>  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br><br>  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>of using an interface provided by the Library.<br><br>  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>Version".<br><br>  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br><br>  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br><br>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br><br>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br><br>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br><br>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>version:<br><br>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br><br>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>   this License applicable to that copy.<br><br>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br><br>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br><br>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>   covered by this License.<br><br>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>   document.<br><br>  4. Combined Works.<br><br>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>the following:<br><br>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>   covered by this License.<br><br>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>   document.<br><br>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br><br>   d) Do one of the following:<br><br>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>       Corresponding Source.<br><br>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>       a copy of the Library already present on the user"s computer<br>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>       Version.<br><br>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br><br>  5. Combined Libraries.<br><br>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>choice, if you do both of the following:<br><br>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br><br>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br><br>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>apply, that proxy"s public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>Library.<br><br>crc16.c/crc16.h<br><br>Copyright 2001-2010 Georges Menie (www.menie.org)<br>All rights reserved.<br>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without<br>modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:<br> <br>      * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright<br>        notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.<br>      * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright<br>        notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the<br>        documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.<br>      * Neither the name of the University of California, Berkeley nor the<br>        names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products<br>        derived from this software without specific prior written permission.<br> <br>  THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE REGENTS AND CONTRIBUTORS ``AS IS"" AND ANY<br>  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED<br>  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE<br>  DISCLAIMED.

By contrast,<br>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>know their rights.<br><br>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br><br>  For the developers" and authors" protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users" and<br>authors" sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>authors of previous versions.<br><br>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>protecting users" freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br><br>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>  0. Definitions.<br><br>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br><br>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>works, such as semiconductor masks.<br><br>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br><br>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br><br>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>on the Program.<br><br>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br><br>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br><br>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br><br>  1. Source Code.<br><br>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>form of a work.<br><br>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>is widely used among developers working in that language.<br><br>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br><br>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work"s<br>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>subprograms and other parts of the work.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>Source.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>same work.<br><br>  2. Basic Permissions.<br><br>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br><br>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br><br>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>makes it unnecessary.<br><br>  3. Protecting Users" Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br><br>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>measures.<br><br>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work"s<br>users, your or third parties" legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>technological measures.<br><br>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br><br>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program"s source code as you<br>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br><br>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br><br>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>    it, and giving a relevant date.<br><br>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>    "keep intact all notices".<br><br>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br><br>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>    work need not make them do so.<br><br>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation"s users<br>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>parts of the aggregate.<br><br>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br><br>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>in one of these ways:<br><br>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br><br>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>    with subsection 6b.<br><br>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br><br>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>    charge under subsection 6d.<br><br>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>included in conveying the object code work.<br><br>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>the only significant mode of use of the product.<br><br>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>modification has been made.<br><br>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>been installed in ROM).<br><br>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>protocols for communication across the network.<br><br>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>unpacking, reading or copying.<br><br>  7. Additional Terms.<br><br>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br><br>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br><br>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br><br>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br><br>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br><br>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>    authors of the material; or<br><br>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br><br>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>    those licensors and authors.<br><br>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br><br>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>where to find the applicable terms.<br><br>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>the above requirements apply either way.<br><br>  8. Termination.<br><br>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>paragraph of section 11).<br><br>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br><br>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>your receipt of the notice.<br><br>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>material under section 10.<br><br>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br><br>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br><br>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br><br>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>licenses to the work the party"s predecessor in interest had or could<br>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br><br>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br><br>  11. Patents.<br><br>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>work thus licensed is called the contributor"s "contributor version".<br><br>  A contributor"s "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>this License.<br><br>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>patent license under the contributor"s essential patent claims, to<br>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br><br>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>patent against the party.<br><br>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>covered work in a country, or your recipient"s use of the covered work<br>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br><br>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>work and works based on it.<br><br>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br><br>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br><br>  12. No Surrender of Others" Freedom.<br><br>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br><br>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>combination as such.<br><br>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br><br>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy"s<br>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>to choose that version for the Program.<br><br>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>later version.<br><br>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br><br>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  16. Limitation of Liability.<br><br>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br><br>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br><br>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br><br>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>    <one line to give the program"s name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br><br>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>    (at your option) any later version.<br><br>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>    GNU General Public License for more details.<br><br>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br><br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br><br>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br><br>    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w".<br>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>    under certain conditions; type `show c" for details.<br><br>The hypothetical commands `show w" and `show c" should show the appropriate<br>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program"s commands<br>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br><br>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br><http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br><br>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>Public License instead of this License.
